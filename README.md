# Introduction

There's this tradition where I make a small game for my sister on her birthday every year. 

This year (2020), I made this tiny game for her.

This game isn't limited to the web app.

Once you figure out the item as described by the clue, you need to search for a paper scroll. This scroll is hidden somewhere near the actual item at home. For example, if the clue points to a fridge, the scroll will be in the freezer. 

Once you find the scroll, it will have the incantation you need to move on to the next round in the game. You need to type the words (incantation) from the scroll into the input field of the web app.
