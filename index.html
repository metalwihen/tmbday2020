						<p align="left"><h3>I will describe the item:</h3></p>
						<pre id="clue-item-1">
The hooman puts me in their toy
where most times, I can roam free
It's not that I don't like this toy
but rather I'm scared of where it will take me

Once, this toy took me to a hell
where white-clad hoomans did unspeakable things
they held me down, poked my butt,
then stabbed me - oh, did it sting!

It's not that don't like <strong>this toy</strong>
So let me say this again, if you will
it shakes and growls and its most fun
as long as it stays perfectly still
						</pre>
						<pre id="clue-item-2" class="gone">
The hoomans are not always happy
Sometimes, I see the hooman weep
because <strong>their toy</strong> will sometimes blink
and before bed time, it falls asleep
						</pre>
						<pre id="clue-item-3" class="gone">
Now a days, the hooman does not play with me
They just sit with <strong>this toy</strong> and stare
Then, all of a sudden, 
they will talk very loudly,
even though no one is there. 
						</pre>
						<pre id="clue-item-4" class="gone">
Sometimes when I'm sleeping
the hoomans make lots of noise 
they run all over the house
lifting and moving their toys

But then they shake this wonderful <strong>thing</strong>
for which I most certainly will come out
Then they hold me, lift me, hug me
and then at me, they will shout
						</pre>
						<pre id="clue-item-5" class="gone">
The hoomans are very mean.
When I use <strong>it</strong>, 
the human must lift me,
then sniff me,
then wet me.
Why is the hooman so mean?
						</pre>
						<pre id="clue-item-6" class="gone">
Sometimes in the morning
the hooman goes outside
he moves his arms
and jumps around
and its a state of alarm

The birds fly far away,
the trees shake and the leaves fall,
it's fun to watch the hooman
play with <strong>this toy</strong> so tall
